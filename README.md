**hey!**

Source code for my personal website.


* According to the site, I'm too stupid to fix the bugs.
* According to the site, I like to fork random repos. In fact, this repo code website thing is a fork
  

I'm surprised you're even out here checking the repo. Normally no one cares.


        ✯ Inspiration: NTTS, Elysia & Vee's website               
        ✯ Forked from https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight, but I made the background black entirely.
