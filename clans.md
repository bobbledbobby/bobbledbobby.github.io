## How do I join a Clan?
It's a rollout system. This means only a few people gets access to join clans.

**HOWEVER**, to bypass the rollout system you can join this server:
[![Clan Discovery Discord Server](https://discord.com/api/guilds/1241787240519303309/widget.png)](https://discord.gg/7KpWV6Qux4)

Then, go to the `#guilds` channel and join clans.

## The Experiment
You can use Experiments to get access to clan tags and clan discovery feature.

 1. Download [Vencord](https://vencord.dev).
 2. Go to your User Settings
 3. Go to the `Plugins` tab and enable the "Experiments" plugin.
 4. Refresh your Discord client
 5. Go to your User Settings
 6. Scroll down to "Experiments"
 7. Enable everything that has the word "Clan" in it.

## SUBLIMAL MESSAGING
* **I AM NOT DISCORD STAFF. I CAN NOT GIVE YOU THE ROLLOUT**
* **I AM ALSO NOT STAFF IN THE SERVERS YOU DECIDE TO APPLY IN. I CANNOT GUARANTEE MEMBERSHIP**
