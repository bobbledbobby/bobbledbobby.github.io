A bot will DM you saying you just got Free Nitro.

* **NOTE**: Discord will never DM you if they want to give you Free Nitro. If they do, they'd put it in the app itself.

People would typically click on the "Claim" button and it'll ask you to authorize an app. The app would most likely have permissions that includes but is not limited to "`Know your email address` or `Join servers for you`".

Once you authorize the app, it might add you to random servers, or email you random garbage.

If you fell for it, do the following:
* Go to User Settings â†’ Authorized Apps
* Deauthorize everything with the "Join servers for you"
* Deauthorize everything with the "Access your email address"

Did you just get a DM from someone that claims to be Discord Staff or Steam Support? **IT'S A SCAM.**

If anyone on Discord sends you a DM (direct message) stating that your account has been reported by accident, it's a scam.

* I don't really know much about Steam, so I'll give you this [support link](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3195-9FFB-BA06-F25B)
  * Don't login to any site that isn't https://store.steampowered.com.

If Discord wants to contact you, it's going to be through a system message. A system message looks like this:
