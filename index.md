## About Me!
* **😼 ISTP-T**
  * Am an introvert. Don't talk to me, I'll talk to you.
* ✏️ I like spotify, sketching, writing and most importantly, _breathing air_.
  * I imagine things to draw things. For example, give me a corner somewhere, and I'll try to draw the rest, I guess!
  * I'm a swiftie, I listen to dream, rachel platten and basically everything!
* **💀 I'm funny (sometimes)**

## What do I specifically do?
* I like to fork random things from Github & add stuff.
* I like spotify, and sketching!
* I mod Discord servers!
  * You can DM me about this!
  * brokentherapist.exe: ~300 members
* **📨 Address** You can meet me IRL at `Planet Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, Observable Universe, Universe`!
