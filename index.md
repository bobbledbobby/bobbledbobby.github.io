* **üòº ISTP-T**
  * Am an introvert. Don't talk to me, I'll talk to you.
* ‚úèÔ∏è I like spotify, sketching, writing and most importantly, _breathing air_.
  * I imagine things to draw things. For example, give me a corner somewhere, and I'll try to draw the rest, I guess!
  * I'm a swiftie, I listen to dream, rachel platten and basically everything!
* **üíÄ I'm funny (sometimes)**
