# Hey there!

I'm Kodie!
* **😼 ISTP-T**
  * Am an introvert. Don't talk to me, I'll talk to you.
* ✏️ I sketch and write.
* ☠️ I'm **funny** (sometimes)
* 🤓 I hate the `Sound's World` server.
* 💥 I [collect comics](https://kodedkodie.github.io/wip)

######  

I have a Discord account to chat with my friends and cool people (psst, you! but don't tell the others.) My user is `kodedkodie`. My friend requests are open if you're a friend of a friend. My DMs are open. Please check the website [nohello.net](https://nohello.net) before DMing me.

You can use my DMs if you have any music suggestions (yes, this is a cry for help, I desperately need music recommendations) or if you want to talk about literally anything! To be honest, I'd prefer if you would go to the servers I talk in, like [NTTS](https://discord.gg/ntts) or [BTE](https://discord.gg/EzHjKDJJZ3). Just don't send me anything NSFW/NSFL. For more of my social media, you can go [here](https://kodedkodie.github.io/contact-me). I do have Reddit if I want to have a good laugh.
