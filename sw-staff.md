# Sound's World Staff: Who should be demoted?

## Trainee Moderators
## Moderators
* **Adam**:
  * He false bans people and stuff. For example last time, when someone asked someone else "_why did ur pronouns change_", he banned the user for, quote unquote, transphobia.
  * However, he is the only fast one in SW chat.
* **Braden**:
  * Yeah sure he's a good mod. He punishes people correctly.
  * No. He sometimes `>warns` for no reason and lockdowns the server.
