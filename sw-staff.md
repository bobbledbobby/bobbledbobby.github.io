# Sound's World Staff: Who should be demoted?

## Trainee Moderators
* **Yunno**
  * who the heck

## Moderators
* **Adam**:
  * He false bans people and stuff. For example last time, when someone asked someone else "_why did ur pronouns change_", he banned the user for, quote unquote, transphobia.
  * However, he is the only fast one in SW chat.
* **Braden**:
  * Yeah sure he's a good mod. He punishes people correctly.
  * No. He sometimes `>warns` for no reason and lockdowns the server.
* **PinkUnicorn**:
  * Why is she on this list? She got SoTM multiple times and honorable-mentioned multiple times. Heck, why is she not HMod?
* **cubez**:
  * She's a decent moderator. She punishes people, but as I said, no one's faster than Adam.
  * She gets one bonus point for making Henri.
